            The concert season is the crux of PPE's activities, and the pre-concert practicing season is the second main event. The problem? Princeton has locked down every last publically-playable piano on campus. Pictured is the piano in Butler College's 1942 lounge. Also locked are pianos in Frist Campus Center, the other residential colleges, and more.

            Some pianists have gotten around the practicing problem by securing access to Princeton's practice rooms. While the rooms have recently been opened to the public, pianists only get a limited amount of time each week to use them. Mangum is shown here playing in Effron, Princeton's premier musical building. Each room is hung from the ceiling to ensure acoustical isolation.

            The other option for piano practice: the digital piano. Many of the on-campus PPE members are using keyboards this semester to work on pieces in their rooms, wearing headphones to avoid getting noise complaints. Keyboards don't have the depth of a real piano, but they suffice for most (non-performance) purposes.

            But PPE members don't just practice 24/7. In a normal semester, the group would be chock-full of actual, in-person activities. This year, the most they can do is arrange informal (non-PPE-related) meetups to recapture some of that social spirit that used to come with being a pianist – at least, with being a pianist at Princeton.

            PPE has obligatory Zoom meetings as well. Shown here is a PPE officer meeting, screenshot courtesy of Matthew Pickering '24. It hasn't been a normal semester, nor a normal year, but PPE has managed to keep on going. Members have arranged the pieces for this year's (virtual) concert and are busy working on them. Even if everyone's lives have been put on hold, one way or the other, we can always count on good music, classical or otherwise, to keep on lifting our spirits.
